## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, EJS, Express, MongoDB, 

The coinflip allows you to choose tupac or biggie. If the outcome is Tupac and you also chose Tupac, you win. IF the outcome is different than the your choice, you lose.


## Features in the Future:



- Background changes based on outcome
- I want the user to be able to change the background or dark mode



## Lessons Learned:

I learned that coding is involved critical thinking to meet a goal but there are ways to meet said goal. With that mind, I realize I need to focus on the goal and the route I should take.
